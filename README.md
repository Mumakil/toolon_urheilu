Töölön Urheilu
==============

This app aims to provide a solution to the question "Is there a sports event in Taka-Töölö tonight so every bar is filled with drunk icehockey/football/etc fan?".

General
-------

The app is written in coffeescript and naturally based on nodejs. Express works as the web server and things are rendered using jade templates. The app can be run by anything that supports a Procfile, and in this case it's norman locally and Heroku in web.

Running locally
---------------

  * Install dependencies with `npm install`. 
  * Install grunt-cli with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
  * Start server using `grunt server`.
